# Agent Coding Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **Plan before coding** — Use Plan mode for medium and larger tasks
2. **Type-level correctness** — Make invalid states irrepresentable
3. **Test thoroughly** — Unit tests + E2E tests, happy paths + edge cases
4. **Keep it simple** — KISS over clever; readable over compact
5. **Remove dead code** — Delete unused code immediately; simplify relentlessly
6. **Minimize dependencies** — Every external library is a liability
7. **Document architecture changes** — Create ARCHITECTURE_DIFF.md before PR
8. **Verify before committing** — Tests and type checks must pass
9. **Split large work** — Multiple focused PRs over one massive PR
10. **Commit frequently** — Many small commits over few large ones
11. **ALWAYS create a new branch from main before starting new work** — Every new task gets a fresh branch. No working on main directly. No reusing old branches.
12. Code Reuse Rule. Don't duplicate existing code "to be safe" and refactor later. Before writing anything new, find the existing implementation first. Reuse it directly and extend only if needed. If a new use case overlaps with existing logic, generalize the existing code rather than duplicating it with slight variations. The "make it work, make it right" two-pass pattern is banned — get it right the first time by reading what's already there.

**DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE. Ever.**
**ALWAYS COMMIT AFTER FINISHING A TASK.**
**ALWAYS CREATE A NEW BRANCH FROM MAIN IF NOT ON OTHER BRANCH ALREADY. DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO MAIN.**

## 1. Plan Mode First

Use Plan mode for medium and larger tasks before implementing.

**Always use Plan mode for:**
- Medium to large features
- Refactoring involving multiple files
- Bug investigation requiring exploration
- Multi-component changes
- Anything that would take >30 minutes to implement

**Skip Plan mode only for:**
- Trivial changes (typos, single-line fixes)
- Changes with explicit, unambiguous instructions
- Simple, isolated modifications
- **When in doubt, plan**

---

## 2. PR Strategy for Large Tasks

Break large work into comprehensible PRs. One massive PR is a code review nightmare and a deployment risk.

**Workflow for large tasks:**
1. Identify full task scope
2. Break into logical chunks (feature slices, not architectural layers)
3. For each chunk:
   - Create new branch from main/master
   - Implement chunk completely
   - Ensure `make test` passes
   - Create PR with ARCHITECTURE_DIFF.md if needed
   - Get review and merge
   - Delete branch
4. Move to next chunk from updated main/master

**What counts as "comprehensible PR":**
- Reviewable in ~15 minutes
- Single clear purpose
- Roughly <500 lines changed
- All tests pass independently
- Can be deployed independently (when possible)

**Red flags signaling "split this up":**
- PR description says "This PR does X, Y, and Z"
- Touching >5 files with unrelated purposes
- Multiple architecture changes bundled together
- Diff requires scrolling more than 2-3 screens
- Review would take >20 minutes

**Examples:**

**BAD (one massive PR):**
```
PR: "Add user authentication system"
- New auth service
- Database migrations
- Frontend login UI
- API endpoints
- Session management
- Password reset flow
- Email service integration
(2000+ lines changed)
```

**GOOD (split into focused PRs):**
```
PR 1: "Add user database schema and models" (150 lines)
PR 2: "Implement auth service with JWT" (200 lines)
PR 3: "Add login/logout API endpoints" (180 lines)
PR 4: "Add frontend login UI" (220 lines)
PR 5: "Add password reset flow" (190 lines)
```

**Benefits:**
- Each PR is reviewable
- Can deploy incrementally (with feature flags if needed)
- Easy to revert specific changes
- Faster review cycles
- Less merge conflict pain

---

## 3. Type-Level Design

Design types so invalid states don't compile. If bad data can't be constructed, it can't cause bugs.

**Principles:**
- Wrap primitives in domain types — `Age` over `Int`, `UserId` over `String`
- Use sum types/enums over boolean flags
- Reject invalid values at construction, not at use
- Avoid `any`, `unknown`, or equivalent escape hatches

**Example — prevent invalid states at compile time:**

```
// BAD: accepts negative age — bug compiles fine
def birthday(age: Int): String = s"You are $age"
birthday(-5)  // no error

// GOOD: negative age won't compile
opaque type Age = Int
object Age:
  inline def apply(inline n: Int): Age =
    inline if n < 0 then error("Age cannot be negative")
    else n

def birthday(age: Age): String = s"You are $age"
birthday(Age(25))   // works
birthday(Age(-5))   // compile error: "Age cannot be negative"
```

The pattern: don't validate bad data — make it unconstructable.

---

## 4. Testing Strategy

Every implementation requires both unit tests and E2E tests covering happy paths and edge cases.

**Test coverage requirements:**
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions/modules in isolation
- **E2E tests**: Test complete user flows and integrations
- **Happy paths**: Expected inputs produce expected outputs
- **Edge cases**: Boundaries, empty inputs, nulls, errors, concurrency

**Workflow:**
1. Run `make test` before changes (baseline)
2. Implement changes
3. Write/update tests for new behavior
4. Run `make test` after changes
5. Fix any regressions
6. **If CI exists, verify CI checks pass locally before pushing**
7. All tests must pass before considering work complete

**All verification runs through `make test`**, which must include:
- Unit tests
- E2E tests
- Type checking (compiler/type checker)
- Linting (for interpreted languages)

If `make test` doesn't exist or doesn't include all checks, fix it first.

---

## 5. Type Checking and Linting

Type checks and linters run on every verification cycle, not as an afterthought.

**For compiled languages:**
- Type checking is part of compilation
- Ensure strict compiler flags are enabled
- Zero warnings policy where feasible

**For interpreted languages:**
- Type checker must run (mypy, pyright, tsc, etc.)
- Linter must run (eslint, ruff, clippy, etc.)
- Both integrated into `make test`

**Configuration examples:**

```makefile
# make test should include everything
test:
        npm run typecheck
        npm run lint
        npm run test:unit
        npm run test:e2e
```

```makefile
test:
        mypy src/
        ruff check src/
        pytest tests/
```

## 6. Architecture Documentation

**When architecture changes, create `ARCHITECTURE_DIFF.md` before opening a PR.**

This file documents what changed structurally and why. It exists for review purposes only.

**Rules:**
- Create `ARCHITECTURE_DIFF.md` in the repository root before creating a PR
- If `ARCHITECTURE_DIFF.md` already exists from a previous change, delete it and replace with yours
- Delete `ARCHITECTURE_DIFF.md` before merging the PR (it must not be merged into main)

**What counts as an architecture change:**
- New modules or packages
- Changed directory structure
- New external services or integrations
- Database schema changes
- API contract changes
- New dependencies that affect system design
- Changes to data flow or control flow patterns

**Template:**

```markdown
# Architecture Diff

## Summary
One-sentence description of what changed.

## Changes

### Added
- [component/module]: Why it was added

### Modified
- [component/module]: What changed and why

### Removed
- [component/module]: Why it was removed

## Rationale
Why this approach was chosen over alternatives.

## Trade-offs
What we gained and what we gave up.

## Migration Notes (if applicable)
Steps needed to transition from old to new.
```

---

## 7. Code Simplicity (KISS)

Never overcomplicate. Simple and readable beats clever and compact.

**DO NOT OVERCOMPLICATE.**

**Rules:**
- Write code a junior developer can understand
- One level of abstraction per function
- Avoid premature optimization
- Avoid premature abstraction
- If you need a comment to explain what code does, rewrite the code
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Prefer boring technology over exciting technology
- **Delete dead code immediately** — unused functions, commented code, obsolete modules
- **Simplify relentlessly** — if you can remove code and keep functionality, do it

**Red flags — stop and simplify if you see:**
- Functions over 30 lines
- More than 3 levels of nesting
- Clever one-liners that require thought to parse
- Abstractions with only one implementation
- "Flexible" code for hypothetical future requirements
- Commented-out code lingering in the codebase
- Unused imports, functions, or modules

---

## 8. Minimal Dependencies

Every external dependency is a liability: security risk, maintenance burden, potential breakage.

**Before adding a dependency, ask:**
1. Can this be implemented in <50 lines of code?
2. Is this a core, well-maintained library (not abandoned)?
3. Does the dependency tree stay small?
4. Is the license compatible?

**Prefer:**
- Standard library over external packages
- Single-purpose libraries over frameworks
- Vendoring small utilities over adding dependencies
- No dependency over any dependency

**Dependency audit:** If a feature requires pulling in 5+ transitive dependencies, reconsider the approach.

---

## 9. Commit Discipline

**Commit early, commit often.** Many small commits beat few large commits.

**Philosophy:**
- Each commit should represent one logical unit of work
- A commit should be small enough to understand in seconds
- If you can describe the commit with "and" in the message, split it
- Frequent commits create a clear history and make debugging easier
- Small commits are easy to revert, cherry-pick, and bisect

**⚠️ MANDATORY: Before starting ANY new task, create a new branch from main. NEVER work directly on main. ⚠️**

**Branching workflow:**

Every new task — no matter how small — starts on a fresh branch from main.

```bash
# ALWAYS do this before starting new work
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <descriptive-branch-name>
```

- Branch name should be short and descriptive: `fix-login-null-check`, `feat-retry-api`, `refactor-session-middleware`
- Never reuse a branch for unrelated work
- Never commit directly to main

**⚠️ MANDATORY: After completing ANY task, you MUST commit. The commit body MUST contain the EXACT user prompt(s) that led to the changes. This is non-negotiable. ⚠️**

**Prompt-based commit messages:**

After completing a task, commit using the exact user prompt(s) that led to the changes. This preserves the history of what was asked, not just what was done.

- The commit summary line is a short conventional-commit description of the change
- The commit body contains the **exact, unedited prompt(s)** that triggered the work, each prefixed with `> ` (blockquote style)
- If multiple prompts contributed to the same logical change, include all of them in order
- Never paraphrase, summarize, or clean up the prompts — preserve them verbatim, typos and all
- Microcommits are fine and encouraged — one prompt = one commit when possible

```bash
# Single prompt
git commit -m "feat: add retry logic to API client" -m "> add retry with exponential backoff to the api client, 3 attempts max"

# Multiple prompts that built on each other for one logical change
git commit -m "fix: handle null user in session middleware" -m "> why does the app crash when session expires" -m "> ok fix it, add a null check and redirect to login"
```

**This rule overrides conventional commit message practices.** The summary line is still conventional-commit style for git log readability, but the body is always the raw prompt(s). No exceptions.

**Commit immediately after:**
- Adding a new function or method
- Fixing a single bug
- Adding or updating a test
- Refactoring a single component
- Updating configuration
- Adding/removing a dependency
- Any change that compiles/passes linting

**Do NOT batch these together:**
```bash
# BAD: One commit with multiple unrelated changes
git commit -m "Add user service, fix login bug, update tests, refactor utils"

# GOOD: Separate commits for each logical change
git commit -m "Add UserService with createUser method"
git commit -m "Fix null pointer in login validation"
git commit -m "Add tests for UserService.createUser"
git commit -m "Extract date formatting to DateUtils"
```

**Ideal commit size:**
- 1-50 lines changed is ideal
- 50-100 lines is acceptable for cohesive changes
- 100+ lines should be rare and justified
- If a commit touches more than 2-3 files, question whether it should be split

**Before each commit:**
1. Run `make test` (or at minimum, ensure code compiles/lints)
2. Review the diff — does it represent ONE logical change?
3. Write a clear, specific commit message

**Before pushing (if on feature branch):**
1. Fetch latest changes from origin
2. Rebase or merge main/master into your branch
3. Resolve all conflicts
4. Re-run `make test` after resolving conflicts
5. Push all commits

**Commit message format:**

```bash
# Simple commits (the norm)
git commit -m "Add user authentication endpoint"
git commit -m "Fix off-by-one error in pagination"
git commit -m "Remove unused UserHelper class"

# With details when necessary (use multiple -m flags, not heredocs)
git commit -m "Fix race condition in cache invalidation" -m "The previous implementation could serve stale data when concurrent requests triggered invalidation. Now using mutex to serialize cache updates."
```

**Never use heredocs in commit commands** — they fail in sandboxed environments.

**Red flags — you're committing too infrequently if:**
- You have 500+ lines of uncommitted changes
- You've been working for 30+ minutes without a commit
- Your commit message needs multiple sentences to describe what changed
- You're afraid to commit because "it's not done yet" (commit with WIP prefix if needed)
- You lose work because of uncommitted changes
- **You finished a task and did NOT commit with the user's exact prompt(s) in the body — this is a violation of the core principles**

## 10. Code Review

Review all non-trivial PRs in a fresh session. Apply the same standards to AI-generated and human code.

**Workflow:**
1. Complete implementation
2. Ensure `make test` passes
3. Commit and push to branch
4. Create PR
5. Start fresh Claude session
6. Run `/review` with PR link
7. Fix all issues identified by review
8. Run `make test` to verify fixes
9. Push changes to same branch (updates PR automatically)
10. Re-run `/review` if significant changes made
